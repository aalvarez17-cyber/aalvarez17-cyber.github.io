      <h1>This is my Homepage</h1>
      <p>This is my first html project without any use of CSS. </p>
      <p>This will be one of many files that will be found in my github which you will give you a glimpse into my growth in HTML</p>

      <h3>These are some of the goals in the future as I continue to use HTML</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Understand to what extent CSS can style a HTML file</li>
        <li>Learn how to incorporate Javascript into HTML</li>
        <li>Have fun!</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h1>Why I want to learn HTML, CSS, and Javascript?</h1>
      <p>The desire to learn these topics is because I want in the future to reflect my creative side on a webpage.</p>
      <p>Often the physical artistic of drawing and designing on paper never really came naturally to me, yet here a more structured and user design process allows me to shine.</p>
      <p>I also like to learn how webpages work.</p>

      <h1>Future Questions going into Web design</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>What types of security aspect are involved in webdesign?</li>
        <li>How much actual time and resources are companies using for the design of their websites?</li>
        <li>How does a webpage handle data input by a user?</li>
        <li>How do hackers deface websites?</li>
      </ol>

      <h1>Past Experience</h1>
      <p>Before this class I was able to take some computer science courses in my highschool to learn HTML and CSS.</p>
      <p>I was able to explore a good amount of concepts mainly in CSS to make my webpage look pretty good for a highschooler.</p>
      <p>The drastic diffrences from then and now is that the speed at which things are done in college are must faster which is good aspect as often it was boring doing the same couple barebone HTML pages.</p>
      <p>A tool that was used then and now is W3schools, it's amazing how such a website comes back to even help me in the college years.</p>
